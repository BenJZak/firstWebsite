			<h2>Some of My Work:</h2>
			<h3>Appreciating Beauty in Nature</h3>
			<p>
				ㅤㅤㅤ“Eudaimonia” is a greek word that when translated into English means “of good spirit.” Personally, I am a strong believer in the concepts that Aristotlean ethics offers us, that being, ‘people should strive to achieve an excellent character.’ One of the key components to achieving an excellent character to me is having a strong connection to nature. Expanding from this, the modern world obstructs our human connection with nature and that is a concerning thought. People nowadays are too busy to take a second out of their day to realize that the world around them is filled with a divine beauty far broader than any living person's understanding. People derive their relative meaning of beauty in many different ways; my ideas of beauty might be similar to yours, but they definitely cannot simply co-exist. I find that I can find the beauty of nature on my normal morning route to school which I travel daily. The beauty that nature has to offer is one of the main reasons that I get up early in the morning and contributes largely to my motivation. I will consistently wake up early every morning and spring out of bed with a sense of motivation unlike any other, simply because I experience an innate sense of euphoria from the artistry and elegance of the morning sunrise. Every morning I am fortunate enough to experience the beauty and intricacy of the raging colors of red, yellow, orange, and light blue streaking the sky like a professional painter covering his canvas. Motivation to get up in the morning can be derived from an infinite amount of sources, but it is limited to the mind of the individual. Beauty in nature is one of the main ways that I derive happiness from a world filled with adversity and pain. There is a present counter-argument, “how is it possible to marvel over nature if it is being concealed by the unsightly modernized world?” The thing is, there is intricate beauty in this too! People are constantly conceptualizing modern cities such as Philadelphia and New York City as nothing more than overpolluted concrete jungles filled with day-to-day, pessimistic-minded people. To me, modern cities portray a different kind of beauty that still is present in natural beauty. Seeing the progression that humanity has been able to accomplish over just the past few hundred years fuels my thoughts on the evolution of beauty.

			<h3>
				Happiness, Wonder, and Motivation
			</h3>
			<p>
				ㅤㅤㅤ“Anhedonia,” is a term that describes a lack of interest in activities that an individual used to enjoy in the past, but now in the present no longer displays any enthusiasm towards. The reason we as humans attend universities is to specialize in one field very well, and arguably any time spent doing anything else is pretty much considered to be a waste. We also accept a lot of things that we experience daily with no real interest. For example, how does Bluetooth actually work? Maybe if you are really in need of an answer, you can turn to Google for an answer, monotonously read it, think to yourself “interesting” or “cool” and quickly dispel the newfound knowledge as quickly as possible unless it specifically serves you in some way. This is one of my biggest problems with modern society, is the lack of curiosity and wonder. Curiosity is the driving force for the evolution of humans, there is something overwhelming about the idea of new discoveries and exploration. The universe that we live in is infinitely large and complex, there will forever be more questions than feasible answers. The thing is, if you suffer from depression, you lack the desire to gain any knowledge about anything at all. When experiencing depression, you are already experiencing the weight of basic everyday tasks such as showering and doing laundry; why would you burden yourself with the infinitely beautiful world around you, it doesn’t make any sense at all. It is given that to a certain extent, being curious is a matter of personality. Those who are extroverted and open are likely far more willing to explore, question, and make the effort to learn new things. When you deduce curiosity down just to personality, you may come up with the conclusion that developing a sense of curiosity is outside human ability. But that really just is not the case, curiosity is actually very natural. Jean Piaget, a developmental psychologist, argues that curiosity is the main mechanism that allows us as humans to develop in the world. Piaget argued that social-cognitive development is primarily fuelled by the intention to explore and integrate new perspectives of the self and the world. Piaget did a considerable amount of research on the cognitive behavior of children and young adults. A conversation between an adult and a seven-year-old child led Piaget to formulate a period of childhood egocentrism. The child was asked if the moon moves or not and the child responded with “When we go, it goes,” and when asked how the child responded, “When we walk, it goes by itself.” The reason I bring this up is to segway me to my next thought; this might be a bit difficult but try to remember one of those days as a child when you were really young and having the absolute time of your life. Picture an open field, running around with a few of your friends with no care in the world, maybe you can remember playing on the playground or having a fun day at the beach. These experiences are overwhelmingly stimulating to the mind, at least as a child. Nowadays you are rarely impressed by the design on the back of a ladybug or the intricate patterns of barren trees. However, there’s also something else going on here. Bringing up Piaget again, he conceptualized the pre-existing idea that kids not only experience new things in the world but are also constantly developing new views of their own existence! This is something that, once hitting puberty, we sort of lose the ability to do. When we as humans encounter new experiences, we learn about ourselves, and as we learn about ourselves we have the tendency to seek out more new experiences. In a study performed on 125 college students and 51 adults that explored two different forms of growth goals, it was discovered that those who made progress on such goals tended to have higher ego development, another psychological measure commonly used to assess maturity. It is very interesting when you think about it, maturity is directly associated with curiosity. So, the next time you are feeling incurious and too mature to ask a question about life, try to remember that curiosity and wonder is if anything, a sign of personal development. By taking an active interest in the world, in doing so, you are likely to develop a far more complex and differentiated idea of your own self. Curiosity is not so much the newness of the experience as it is the way that you approach it. Without the sense of exploration and innovation, we aren’t really serving our function as living human beings. Whether you are doing something mentally stimulating like riding a roller coaster, or something as mundane as waiting in line at the DMV, just try to be curious at the absolute very least. Who knows what you might learn about the world and about yourself? With a refined sense of curiosity, maybe life could be just a bit more tolerable.

			<h3>My Own Beliefs</h3>
			<p>
				ㅤㅤㅤFrom the moment that we are born into this world, our minds are like sponges that soak up the new surrounding knowledge. Our immediate environment is a critical factor that initially influences our personalities, opinions, and our fundamental beliefs. It is exceedingly important to challenge any core values you hold to be true, even if you deem no change of mind or heart in the end. While this can be on a wide scale, large or minute, I challenged the truths that I had believed in all of my life and developed a new perspective on the different ways to live.
We don’t have much say in what we are taught when we are younger. I hold no grudge against my parents for this, and neither should you. An important part of what makes us human is our unique upbringings, something that we are not necessarily able to choose upon birth. Thankfully for me, my parents instilled in me good values and morals that shaped me into the young man I am today. While I definitely maintained respect for their faith, I learned how to question things that I did not understand.
	I was born into a very religious family. When growing up in this type of home, you are expected to follow in the footsteps and teachings that the religion has to offer. This worked flawlessly for me through many of the earlier stages of my life; whenever I sought guidance, I turned to the teachings that I had learned at a young age and found comfort in their simplicity. It was not until I became more aware of the truth of the rather pessimistic world around me that I started to question the preliminary ideals that I had been founded on, and started pursuing my own way of approaching my life's questions.
	The transition out of one’s core values is never instant. One of the major factors that changed my view on my beliefs, was my first experience of loss. Once I held a firm grip on the concept of loss and realized its permanence, I recognized that faith alone was insufficient to satisfy my burning desire to answer questions. When you ask a person of faith the question, “Why am I deserving of this unfortunate event? I have lived a virtuous life according to God,” the stereotypical response would be, “God has a plan, and everything happens for his sake.” This major lack of explanation does not sit well with me at all, and it was certainly one of the more important motivators to me questioning my previous teachings.
	Through some trial and error, I have more recently made some sense of my ideals by turning to world-renowned philosophers. I have become a student of Lucius Annaeus Seneca, who was a Roman philosopher, and who is often recognized as the most important figure in regard to stoicism. Living a stoic life is accepting the things you cannot control, and is simply the practice of keeping a positive mindset in times of distress. By spending the last few, and arguably the most formative years of my life asking questions, I have changed my life for the better. 
With my newfound knowledge, I can confidently form better relationships, maintain a positive attitude, and be the best version of myself I can possibly be. I’m confident that my friends and family would agree that I have become a more agreeable person due to my change of mind. Not only that, but I believe that this new mindset has affected me academically, which has been demonstrated through more efficient study habits, a better approach to stress, and consequently, a higher grade point average. While I hold my new ideologies close to me, I still understand that there is room for change. I cannot wait to see where my life takes me, and what I might hold true in the future.
