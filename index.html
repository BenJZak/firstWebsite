				ㅤㅤㅤWelcome to my website! My name is Benjamin Zakielarz and I am currently a computer science undergraduate student at Loyola University Maryland. I have always been fascinated by technology and the way that it is shaping the modern world. In my spare time, I enjoy diving into complex philosophical concepts and theories. Most of my free time is spent learning about great thinkers/writers such as: Albert Camus, Aristotle, and Lucius Annaeus Seneca. While I may be introverted by nature, I have big plans for the future and am constantly seeking out new opportunities to grow and learn. My sole aim is to constantly improve and become the best version of myself that I can be. I believe that by consistently working on myself and striving for personal growth, I can reach my full potential and lead a fulfilling and meaningful life. I'm a big fan of nature, hiking, and skiing, although I'm definitely not an expert in any of those areas. I enjoy getting out there and getting some exercise, and I find that these activities are a great way to relax and pass the time. Whether I'm taking it easy on a scenic trail or tackling a more challenging route, I always find a way to have a good time and stay active.

				ㅤㅤㅤIn addition to my studies and interests in computer science and philosophy, I am a huge music lover. I have a diverse taste in music, but my favorites are rock, pop, and indie. I also have a deep love and passion for playing/creating music, specifically the piano. I have been playing the piano for over 10 years and it has always been a source of great joy and creativity for me. Although I used to perform in recitals, I found that my favorite moments with the piano are those spent alone, lost in the music and the emotions it evokes. I am always open to trying new genres and expanding my music taste, so if you have any recommendations, I would love to hear them!
			</p>
			<p>
				ㅤㅤㅤI am excited to see where my studies and passions will take me in the coming years, and I am always open to new challenges and experiences. Thanks for stopping by and getting to know a little bit about me!
